### 6.4 State Management Architecture

**Store Slices:**

1. **PeerSlice** (`peer-slice.ts`)
    - Manages PeerJS instance lifecycle
    - Handles connection establishment
    - Monitors ICE states
    - Processes incoming messages

2. **TransferSlice** (`transfer-slice.ts`)
    - Manages file transfer queue
    - Implements chunking logic
    - Tracks transfer progress
    - Handles downloads

3. **LogSlice** (`log-slice.ts`)
    - Maintains activity log
    - Implements log rotation (max 100 entries)
    - Tracks unread status

4. **UISlice** (`ui-slice.ts`)
    - Manages UI state (log panel open/closed)
    - Tracks hydration status

5. **StorageSlice** (`storage-slice.ts`)
    - Detects storage capabilities
    - Manages storage mode

**State Persistence:**

- Middleware: Zustand `persist` middleware
- Storage: IndexedDB via `idb-keyval`
- Partialize: Selective state persistence (excludes active connections, chunks)

### 6.5 File Transfer Protocol

**Message Types:**

1. **Metadata Message**

    ```typescript
    {
      type: 'metadata',
      transferId: string,        // Unique transfer ID
      metadata: {
        name: string,            // File name
        size: number,            // File size in bytes
        type: string,            // MIME type
        timestamp: number        // Unix timestamp
      },
      totalChunks: number        // Total number of chunks
    }
    ```

2. **Chunk Message**

    ```typescript
    {
      type: 'chunk',
      transferId: string,        // Transfer ID
      chunkIndex: number,        // Chunk index (0-based)
      data: ArrayBuffer          // 64KB chunk data
    }
    ```

3. **Complete Message**
    ```typescript
    {
      type: 'complete',
      transferId: string         // Transfer ID
    }
    ```

**Transfer Flow:**

```
Sender                          Receiver
  │                                │
  ├─── metadata ─────────────────►│ (Create transfer record)
  │                                │
  ├─── chunk[0] ─────────────────►│ (Write to OPFS/RAM)
  ├─── chunk[1] ─────────────────►│
  ├─── chunk[2] ─────────────────►│
  │         ...                    │
  ├─── chunk[N] ─────────────────►│
  │                                │
  ├─── complete ─────────────────►│ (Mark as completed)
  │                                │
```
