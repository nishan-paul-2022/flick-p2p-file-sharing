## 🎯 What is Flick?

**Flick** is a web application that lets you transfer files **directly between devices** without uploading to any server. Think of it as creating a private, temporary bridge between your devices where files flow directly from sender to receiver.

### Real-World Use Cases

- 📱 **Phone to Laptop**: Quickly send photos from your phone to your computer
- 💼 **Work Collaboration**: Share large files with colleagues without email size limits
- 🏠 **Home Network**: Transfer files between family devices instantly
- 🌍 **Cross-Platform**: Works between Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android

---

## 🔬 How Does It Work?

Flick uses **WebRTC** (Web Real-Time Communication) technology to create direct peer-to-peer connections between browsers:

```
Device A  ←→  WebRTC Connection  ←→  Device B
   ↓                                      ↓
Files transfer directly (no middleman!)
```

### The Process (Simplified)

1. **Room Creation**: Device A generates a unique 6-character room code
2. **Connection**: Device B enters the same code to join the room
3. **Handshake**: Devices exchange connection information through a signaling server
4. **Direct Link**: Once connected, a direct peer-to-peer tunnel is established
5. **File Transfer**: Files flow directly between devices in optimized 64KB chunks

### Technical Architecture

- **WebRTC Data Channels**: For direct browser-to-browser communication
- **STUN Servers**: Help devices discover their public IP addresses
- **TURN Servers**: Relay traffic when direct connection isn't possible (firewalls/NAT)
- **OPFS Storage**: Browser's private file system for handling large files efficiently
- **Chunked Transfer**: Files split into 64KB pieces for optimal speed and reliability

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd flick-p2p-file-sharing

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables (see Setup Guide below)
cp .env.example .env

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

---

## 📋 Setup Guide

Follow these steps for a **complete, error-free setup**:

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js 18+** ([Download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git** ([Download](https://git-scm.com/))

Verify installation:

```bash
node --version  # Should be 18.0.0 or higher
npm --version   # Should be 8.0.0 or higher
```

### 2️⃣ Clone & Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd flick-p2p-file-sharing

# Install all dependencies
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Environment Configuration

**This step is CRITICAL for cross-network connections (PC-to-Mobile, Mobile-to-Mobile).**

#### Create Environment File

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Configure Xirsys TURN Server (Required)

For connections to work across different networks (mobile data, firewalls), you need TURN server credentials:

1. **Sign up for Xirsys** (Free tier: 500MB/month)
    - Visit: [https://xirsys.com/](https://xirsys.com/)
    - Click **"Sign Up"** and create a free account
    - Verify your email

2. **Get Your Credentials**
    - Log in to [Xirsys Dashboard](https://dashboard.xirsys.com/)
    - Go to **"Account"** → **"Credentials"**
    - Copy your:
        - **Username** (ident)
        - **Secret Key**
        - **Channel** (you can create one, e.g., "flick-app")

3. **Update `.env` File**

    Open `.env` and replace the placeholder values:

    ```env
    # Xirsys TURN Server Credentials
    NEXT_PUBLIC_XIRSYS_IDENT=your_actual_username
    NEXT_PUBLIC_XIRSYS_SECRET=your_actual_secret_key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_XIRSYS_CHANNEL=your_channel_name
    ```

    **Example:**

    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_XIRSYS_IDENT=john_doe_123
    NEXT_PUBLIC_XIRSYS_SECRET=a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8
    NEXT_PUBLIC_XIRSYS_CHANNEL=flick-production
    ```

#### Optional: Custom PeerJS Server

If you want to use your own PeerJS server (advanced):

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_PEER_HOST=your-peer-server.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_PEER_PORT=9000
NEXT_PUBLIC_PEER_PATH=/myapp
```

**Note:** Leave these empty to use the default public PeerJS server.

### 4️⃣ Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. You should see the Flick home page!

### 5️⃣ Build for Production

```bash
# Create optimized production build
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

The app will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 6️⃣ Verify Setup

Test that everything works:

1. Open the app on **Device A** (e.g., your laptop)
2. Click **"Create New Room"** - note the 6-character code
3. Open the app on **Device B** (e.g., your phone)
4. Enter the room code and click **"Join"**
5. Try sending a file from one device to the other

✅ **If the connection succeeds and file transfers, you're all set!**

---

## 🎯 How to Use

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create a Room**
    - Open Flick on the first device
    - Click **"Create New Room"**
    - A unique 6-character code appears (e.g., `A3X9K2`)

2. **Join from Another Device**
    - Open Flick on the second device
    - Enter the room code
    - Click **"Join Room"**

3. **Wait for Connection**
    - Both devices will show "Connecting..."
    - Once connected, you'll see a green "Connected" status

4. **Send Files**
    - Drag and drop files onto the upload area, OR
    - Click **"Browse Files"** to select from your device
    - Watch real-time progress as files transfer

5. **Receive Files**
    - Received files appear in the **"Received"** tab
    - Click **"Download"** to save to your device

### Tips for Best Experience

- 📶 **Stable Connection**: Use WiFi for large files
- 🔋 **Keep Screen On**: Prevent devices from sleeping during transfer
- 🚀 **Same Network**: Fastest speeds when devices are on the same WiFi
- 🌐 **Cross-Network**: Works across different networks (requires TURN server)
